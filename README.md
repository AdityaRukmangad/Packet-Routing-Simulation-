üß† Advanced Routing Algorithms
The simulator implements five major pathfinding algorithms:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Finds shortest path in terms of hop count
Explores nodes level by level
Guaranteed to find shortest unweighted path


DFS (Depth-First Search)

Explores as far as possible along each branch
Uses stack-based approach
May not find optimal path but useful for comparison


Dijkstra's Algorithm

Finds shortest weighted path
Guarantees optimal solution for non-negative weights
Industry standard for shortest path problems


Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Handles negative edge weights
Detects negative cycles
More robust but slower than Dijkstra


A (A-Star) Algorithm*

Uses heuristic function for faster pathfinding
Combines Dijkstra with distance estimation
Optimal and more efficient than Dijkstra
